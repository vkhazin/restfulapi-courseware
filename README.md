# RESTful Services #

## Description ##

* RESTful API is an application program interface that uses HTTP/S requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data
* RESTful API is based on representational state transfer technology, an architectural style and approach to communications used in web services
* REST Web services systems are used to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources
* RESTful web services are uniform and interoperable contrasted to language or platform specific API's
* RESTful web service are often enough associated with Micro-Services architecture
* RESTful architecture aims at breaking down monolithic application to series of individually deployed and loosely coupled components
* RESTful services programming languages and frameworks
* RESTful services are odd to be designed deploy-able on-premises and on-the-cloud, i.e. location-transparently
* What to do when an end-point fails causing a chain reaction failure?
* Automation of CD/CI are often listed as prerequisites to successful implementation of micro-services architecture 
* Automation of Configuration Management and Service discovery are crucial for a long term success 

## Audience ##
* Application Architects looking to familiarize themselves with RESTful architecture trade-offs compared to a Soa and to monolithic application architecture
* Developers eager to get first hand experience building RESTful services 
* Operations looking to automate web services deployment and monitoring
* DevOps eager to jump into the modern software delivery mindset

## Course's Objectives ##
* Analyze industry motivation for adopting RESTful architecture
* Draw a comparison between Soa (service-oriented architecture) and RESTful architecture
* Discover advantages and disadvantages of RESTful services
* Build RESTful services using different languages and frameworks
* Setup continuous deployment and integration testing
* Discuss configuration management options in comparison to each other
* Get familiar with Service discovery

## Prerequisites ##
* Laptop with admin/root privileges to install required software
* Recent hands-on programming and/or scripting experience
* Software development, delivery, and operational experience 
* Familiarity with software design and architecture patterns: Desktop, Web, Mobile, and Soa
* Familiarity with git source control system
* Exposure to Linux command line

## Course Duration
3 or 4 days

### Why RESTful Services ###
* Software Architecture Patterns
* Life-cycle of an application
* The more agile architecture the better
* Cross platform and multi-tools reality
* Scalability and spikes in load
* Compare Soa to RESTful
* Compare Monolith to Micro-Services

### RESTFull Web Service ###
